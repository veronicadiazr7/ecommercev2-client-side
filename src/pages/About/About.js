        Disposing Of Unwanted Clothing Also Takes A Toll On The
        Environment. In The United States, Individuals Throw Out 60 To 80
              Pounds Of Textile Waste Each Year. It Can Take Months And Even
              Years For These Materials To Fully Break Down In Landfills! By
              Choosing To Buy Secondhand Clothing Instead Of Brand New, You
              Reduce Waste And Help The Planet.

            God has clearly placed humans in a position of responsibility over
            the creation. <br />
            <strong className=""> Genesis 2:15 </strong> says <br />
            <i className="text-md">
              “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to
              work it and take care of it.”

              We recognize that all created things belong to God and that we are
            accountable to Him as stewards of the creation. God commissions us
            to rule over the creation in a way that sustains, protects, and
            enhances his works so that all creation may fulfill the purposes God
            intended for it. We must manage the environment not simply for our
            own benefit but for God′s glory.
